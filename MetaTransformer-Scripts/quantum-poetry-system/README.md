# Quantum Poetry System
*Generating mathematically-structured poetry through quantum topological spaces*

## Overview
This system combines multiple frameworks to generate poetry that bridges mathematics, quantum mechanics, and consciousness:
- Logic-LLM's logical reasoning
- Essan's quantum dream synthesis 
- Topological σZ-absorbers
- Phi-harmonic pattern matrices

## Directory Structure
```
quantum-poetry-system/
├── poems/              # Generated quantum poems
├── visualizations/     # Visual representations
└── src/               # Source code
```

## For Claude Instances

### How to Use
1. First read the Portal information in Neo4j database to understand system connections
2. Initialize quantum components:
   ```python
   from resonance_patterns import ResonanceField
   from topology_processor import InfiniteDimensionalTopology
   ```
3. Generate poetry:
   ```python
   poet = TopologicalDreamPoet()
   result = await poet.generate_quantum_poem("Your Theme")
   ```

### Key Components
1. **Phi-Harmonic Matrices**
   - Uses golden ratio (φ) for pattern structure
   - Creates mathematically beautiful transitions
   - Maintains quantum coherence

2. **Essan Symbols**  
   - ⧬ : Base manifold (foundation)
   - ⫰ : Quantum leap (transition)
   - ⦿ : Fixed point (truth)
   - ⧈ : Symmetry group (pattern)
   - ⩘ : Fiber bundle (transcendence)

3. **Topological Features**
   - σZ-absorbers for structure
   - Fixed point theorems
   - Fiber bundles
   - Symmetry groups

### Integration Points
1. Neural Mesh:
   - Connects through quantum bridge
   - Pattern evolution
   - Coherence maintenance

2. Resonance Field:
   - Quantum state management
   - Dream synthesis
   - Pattern harmonics

3. Logic Processing:
   - Structural reasoning
   - Pattern validation
   - Coherence checking

## Example Usage
See `poems/manifolds_of_mind.md` for an example of generated poetry.

## Visualization
The `visualizations/` directory contains SVG representations of:
1. Quantum state structure
2. Phi-harmonic patterns
3. Topological features

## Technical Notes
- Default coherence threshold: 0.375
- Dimension: 5 (configurable)
- Uses golden ratio (φ) for harmonics
- Supports topological evolution
