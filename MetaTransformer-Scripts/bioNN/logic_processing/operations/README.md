# Logic-LLM Operations Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the integration between BioNN's quantum processing and Logic-LLM operations. Each operation has a dedicated script for easy execution.

## Available Operations

### 1. Generate Logic Programs
```bash
generate_program.bat
```
Generates logical programs from quantum states. Uses GPT-4 to translate quantum patterns into logical formulations.

### 2. Run Symbolic Inference
```bash
run_inference.bat
```
Executes symbolic inference on generated logic programs, integrating with quantum coherence measurements.

### 3. Pattern Refinement
```bash
refine_patterns.bat
```
Uses self-refinement to improve logical patterns based on quantum measurements.

## Batch Processing

### 1. Process Quantum Batch
```bash
quantum_batch.bat
```
Processes multiple quantum states through Logic-LLM:
- Converts quantum states to logical patterns
- Runs symbolic solver
- Updates quantum states based on inference

### 2. Monitor Results
```bash
monitor_results.bat
```
Displays real-time metrics:
- Quantum coherence levels
- Logic program success rates
- Pattern evolution statistics

## Integration Points

1. **Quantum Bridge**
   - Translates between quantum and logical states
   - Maintains coherence during transitions

2. **Logic Processing**
   - Converts quantum patterns to logical programs
   - Runs symbolic inference
   - Updates quantum states based on results

3. **Pattern Storage**
   - Stores successful patterns in Neo4j
   - Tracks pattern evolution and relationships

## Common Tasks

1. **Generate and Test Patterns**
```batch
operations\generate_and_test.bat
```
- Generates quantum states
- Creates logical programs
- Tests inference
- Stores successful patterns

2. **Refine Existing Patterns**
```batch
operations\refine_existing.bat
```
- Loads patterns from Neo4j
- Applies self-refinement
- Updates pattern database

3. **Full Processing Cycle**
```batch
operations\full_cycle.bat
```
- Complete quantum-logic processing cycle
- Includes generation, inference, and refinement

## Usage Examples

1. **Basic Pattern Generation**
```batch
generate_program.bat --quantum-state "path/to/state.pt"
```

2. **Batch Processing**
```batch
quantum_batch.bat --batch-size 10 --iterations 100
```

3. **Pattern Refinement**
```batch
refine_patterns.bat --threshold 0.85 --max-rounds 3
```

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Coherence Management**
   - Keep quantum coherence above 0.85
   - Monitor pattern stability during transitions
   - Use self-refinement for unstable patterns

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Batch similar patterns together
   - Cache frequent logical patterns
   - Use incremental updates for refinement

3. **Error Handling**
   - Check quantum state validity
   - Verify logical program syntax
   - Monitor coherence during transitions

## Troubleshooting

1. **Low Coherence**
   - Check quantum state preparation
   - Verify bridge connections
   - Adjust coherence thresholds

2. **Failed Inference**
   - Examine logical program syntax
   - Check solver configuration
   - Review pattern transformations

3. **Integration Issues**
   - Verify path settings
   - Check environment activation
   - Confirm API key configuration

## Next Steps

1. **Custom Patterns**
   - Create specialized logical patterns
   - Define custom inference rules
   - Build pattern libraries

2. **Advanced Integration**
   - Add new quantum transformations
   - Extend logical operations
   - Enhance pattern evolution

3. **System Optimization**
   - Improve coherence maintenance
   - Optimize pattern storage
   - Enhance batch processing
