Action Selection and Environment Interaction,"
6. For each time step t:
    - For each agent i:
        1. Get current state s_i
        2. Use policy π_i to sample a set of possible actions A_i:
           A_i = {a_i^1, a_i^2, ..., a_i^k}
        
        3. For each action a_i^j in A_i:
            a. Simulate the environment dynamics to get future states s'_i
            b. Use model M to compute the estimated empowerment E_i(s_i, a_i^j)
        
        4. Select action a_i* that maximizes E_i(s_i, a_i^j) for agent i:
           a_i* = argmax E_i(s_i, a_i^j)

7. Execute actions a_1*, a_2*, ..., a_N* in the environment
    - Transition to new state s' = {s'_1, s'_2, ..., s'_N}
    "
Deep Learning Model Update,"
10. Update the deep learning model M for each agent:
    - Sample transitions from replay buffer: (s_i, a_i, E_i)
    - Train the neural network M to predict empowerment more accurately based on state-action pairs:
      Loss = Mean Squared Error between predicted empowerment and observed empowerment
      M(s_i, a_i) ← M(s_i, a_i) - β * gradient (Loss)
    "
Empowerment Calculation for each agent,"
4. Define Empowerment for each agent i:
    - Empowerment E_i = Mutual Information between actions a_i and future states s'_i:
      E_i(s_i, a_i) = H(s'_i | s_i) - H(s'_i | a_i, s_i)
    - Use model M to approximate empowerment from future state samples
      Empowerment can also be computed as the variance of future states achieved by actions a_i

5. Calculate Group Empowerment E_group:
    - E_group = f(E_1, E_2, ..., E_N)
    - Example: E_group = weighted sum of individual empowerments
      E_group = Σ w_i * E_i, where w_i are weights for each agent's contribution to group empowerment
    "
Empowerment Condensed,"
Initialize environment for N agents
Initialize model M (neural network) and policies π_i for each agent

while not terminal_state:
    for each agent i:
        state s_i = get_current_state(i)
        possible_actions A_i = sample_actions(π_i, s_i)
        for each action a_i^j in A_i:
            future_state s'_i = simulate_environment(s_i, a_i^j)
            empowerment E_i(s_i, a_i^j) = model_estimate(M, s_i, a_i^j)
        select action a_i* = argmax(E_i(s_i, a_i^j))
    
    execute actions {a_1*, a_2*, ..., a_N*} in environment
    transition to new state s'
    
    for each agent i:
        reward r_i = (1 - λ) * E_i + λ * E_group
        store_transition(s_i, a_i*, r_i, s'_i) in replay buffer
        update_policy(π_i, replay_buffer)
    
    update_model(M, replay_buffer)

output optimized policies π_i and trained model M
    "
Initialize the Environment and Agents,"
1. Initialize environment dynamics for N agents
    - Each agent i has state s_i and action space A_i
    - Initialize the state s = {s_1, s_2, ..., s_N} of all agents

2. Initialize deep learning model M to approximate empowerment for each agent
    - M(s_i, a_i) -> approximates empowerment for agent i
    - Use a neural network (NN) to represent the model M

3. Initialize policy π_i for each agent i
    - π_i(s_i) -> selects actions for agent i based on its current state
    - Use policy optimization (e.g., PPO, DDPG) for learning the optimal policy
    "
Multi-Agent Interaction and Cooperation,"
11. Group Cooperation:
    - Encourage cooperation by adjusting the reward function to include the group's total empowerment:
      r_i = (1 - λ) * E_i + λ * E_group
    - Agents balance their own empowerment with the overall group performance by controlling λ (cooperation factor)

12. Communication and Coordination:
    - Agents can share limited information, such as their predicted future states or empowerment estimates
    - Use this information to adjust individual policies to avoid conflicts or overlap in actions
    "
Policy Update and Learning (Reinforcement Learning),"
8. Collect experience (s, a, r, s'):
    - Reward r = Group Empowerment: r = E_group
    - Store the transition in replay buffer for each agent (s_i, a_i*, r, s'_i)

9. Update the policy π_i for each agent using reinforcement learning:
    - Use policy optimization algorithms such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) or Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG)
    - Minimize the negative reward (or maximize empowerment) by updating π_i:
      π_i(s_i) ← π_i(s_i) + α * gradient (reward)
    "
Termination and Results,"
13. Repeat the process at each time step until the environment reaches a terminal state or a predefined condition is met.

14. Output:
    - The policy π_i for each agent is optimized to maximize both individual and group empowerment
    - The deep learning model M is trained to predict empowerment accurately for faster decision-making
