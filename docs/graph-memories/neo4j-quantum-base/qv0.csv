(:Framework {name: Multi-Agent Empowerment Framework})
"(:Step {name: Initialize the Environment and Agents,description: 
1. Initialize environment dynamics for N agents.
2. Initialize deep learning model M to approximate empowerment for each agent.
3. Initialize policy π_i for each agent i.})"
"(:Step {name: Action Selection and Environment Interaction,description: 
For each time step:
- For each agent i, sample actions, simulate dynamics, calculate empowerment, and select the best action.
- Execute actions in the environment and transition to new states.})"
"(:Step {name: Empowerment Calculation for each Agent,description: 
Define individual and group empowerment using mutual information and compute values using model M.})"
"(:Step {name: Multi-Agent Interaction and Cooperation,description: 
Encourage cooperation by adjusting rewards to balance individual and group empowerment.
Share limited information for coordination.})"
"(:Step {name: Policy Update and Learning,description: 
Collect experiences and rewards, update policies using reinforcement learning algorithms like PPO or DDPG.})"
"(:Step {name: Deep Learning Model Update,description: 
Update the model M by training the neural network using replay buffer samples to predict empowerment more accurately.})"
"(:Step {name: Termination and Results,description: 
Repeat the process until a terminal state is reached. Output optimized policies and a trained model.})"
