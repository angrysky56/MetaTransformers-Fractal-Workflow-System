sometimes called “classical elementary logic” or
“classical first-order logic”. Section 2 develops a formal
language, with a rigorous syntax and grammar. The formal language is a
recursively defined collection of strings on a fixed alphabet. As
such, it has no meaning, or perhaps better, the meaning of its
formulas is given by the deductive system and the semantics. Some of
the symbols have counterparts in ordinary language. We define an
argument to be a non-empty collection of sentences in the
formal language, one of which is designated to be the conclusion. The
other sentences (if any) in an argument are its premises. Section 3
sets up a deductive system for the language, in the spirit of natural
deduction. An argument is derivable if there is a deduction
from some or all of its premises to its conclusion. Section 4 provides
a model-theoretic semantics. An argument is valid if there is
no interpretation (in the semantics) in which its premises are all
true and its conclusion false. This reflects the longstanding view
that a valid argument is truth-preserving.})",null,logic_concept,[],1

and the semantics, and in particular, the relationship between
derivability and validity. We show that an argument is derivable only
if it is valid. This pleasant feature, called soundness,
entails that no deduction takes one from true premises to a false
conclusion. Thus, deductions preserve truth. Then we establish a
converse, called completeness, that an argument is valid only
if it is derivable. This shows that the deductive system is rich
enough to provide a deduction for every valid argument. So there are
enough deductions: all and only valid arguments are derivable. We
briefly indicate other features of the logic, some of which are
corollaries to soundness and completeness.})",null,logic_concept,[],1

most large universities, both departments offer courses in logic, and
there is usually a lot of overlap between them. Formal languages,
deductive systems, and model-theoretic semantics are mathematical
objects and, as such, the logician is interested in their mathematical
properties and relations. Soundness, completeness, and most of the
other results reported below are typical examples. Philosophically,
logic is at least closely related to the study of correct
reasoning. Reasoning is an epistemic, mental activity. So logic
is at least closely allied with epistemology. Logic is also a central
branch of computer science, due, in part, to interesting computational
relations in logical systems, and, in part, to the close connection
between formal deductive argumentation and reasoning (see the entries
on
 recursive functions,
 computability and complexity, and

"(:Concept {section: 1. Introduction,source: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-classical/,type: logic_concept,content: One view is that the formal languages accurately exhibit actual
features of certain fragments of a natural language. Some philosophers
claim that declarative sentences of natural language have underlying
logical forms and that these forms are displayed by formulas
of a formal language. Other writers hold that (successful) declarative
sentences express propositions; and formulas of formal
languages somehow display the forms of these propositions. On views

was produced by (3) and (4). Then \(\theta\) is \((\psi_1 \amp
\psi_2)\) and \(\theta\) is also \((\psi_3 \vee \psi_4)\), where
\(\psi_1, \psi_2, \psi_3\), and \(\psi_4\) are themselves formulas.
That is, \((\psi_1 \amp \psi_2)\) is the very same formula as
\((\psi_3 \vee \psi_4)\). By Theorem \(5, \psi_1\) cannot be a proper
part of \(\psi_3\), nor can \(\psi_3\) be a proper part of \(\psi_1\).
So \(\psi_1\) must be the same formula as \(\psi_3\). But then
“\(\amp\)” must be the same symbol as
“\(\vee\)”, and this contradicts the policy that all of
the symbols are different. So \(\theta\) was not produced by both
Clause (3) and Clause (4). Similar reasoning takes care of the other
combinations.})",null,logic_concept,[],1

assume here that the set \(K\) of non-logical terminology is either
finite or denumerably infinite (i.e., the size of the natural numbers,
usually called \(\aleph_0)\). It follows that there is an enumeration
\(\theta_0, \theta_1,\ldots\) of the sentences of \(\LKe\), such that
every sentence of \(\LKe\) eventually occurs in the list. Define a
sequence of sets of sentences, by recursion, as follows: \(\Gamma_0\)
is \(\Gamma\); for each natural number \(n\), if \(\Gamma_n,
\theta_n\) is consistent, then let \(\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n,
\theta_n\). Otherwise, let \(\Gamma_{n+1} = \Gamma_n\). Let
\(\Gamma'\) be the union of all of the sets \(\Gamma_n\). Intuitively,
the idea is to go through the sentences of \(\LKe\), throwing each one
into \(\Gamma'\) if doing so produces a consistent set. Notice that
each \(\Gamma_n\) is consistent. Suppose that \(\Gamma'\) is
inconsistent. Then there is a sentence \(\theta\) such that
\(\Gamma'\vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma'\vdash \neg \theta\). By Theorem
9 and Weakening (Theorem 8), there is finite subset \(\Gamma''\) of
\(\Gamma'\) such that \(\Gamma''\vdash \theta\) and \(\Gamma''\vdash
\neg \theta\). Because \(\Gamma''\) is finite, there is a natural
number \(n\) such that every member of \(\Gamma''\) is in
\(\Gamma_n\). So, by Weakening again, \(\Gamma_n \vdash \theta\) and
\(\Gamma_n \vdash \neg \theta\). So \(\Gamma_n\) is inconsistent,
which contradicts the construction. So \(\Gamma'\) is consistent. Now
suppose that a sentence \(\theta\) is not in \(\Gamma'\). We have to
show that \(\Gamma', \theta\) is inconsistent. The sentence \(\theta\)
must occur in the aforementioned list of sentences; say that
\(\theta\) is \(\theta_m\). Since \(\theta_m\) is not in \(\Gamma'\),
then it is not in \(\Gamma_{m+1}\). This happens only if \(\Gamma_m,
\theta_m\) is inconsistent. So a pair of contradictory opposites can
be deduced from \(\Gamma_m,\theta_m\). By Weakening, a pair of
contradictory opposites can be deduced from \(\Gamma', \theta_m\). So
\(\Gamma', \theta_m\) is inconsistent. Thus, \(\Gamma'\) is maximally

the domain \(d\) of \(M\) must be of size at least \(\kappa\), since

\((B)\) says that if \(A\) is the case, then \(A\) is necessarily
possible. One might argue that \((B)\) should always be adopted in any

that \(A\) is possible. However, there is a problem with this claim

acceptable if \((B)\) is. However, \(\Diamond \Box A\rightarrow A\)
says that if \(A\) is possibly necessary, then \(A\) is the case, and
this is far from obvious. Why does \((B)\) seem obvious, while one of
the things it entails seems not obvious at all? The answer is that
there is a dangerous ambiguity in the English interpretation of
\(A\rightarrow \Box \Diamond A\). We often use the expression
‘If \(A\) then necessarily \(B\)’ to express that the
conditional ‘if \(A\) then \(B\)’ is necessary. This
interpretation corresponds to \(\Box(A\rightarrow B)\). On other
occasions, we mean that if \(A\), then \(B\) is necessary:
\(A\rightarrow \Box B\). In English, ‘necessarily’ is an
adverb, and since adverbs are usually placed near verbs, we have no
natural way to indicate whether the modal operator applies to the
whole conditional or to its consequent. For these reasons, there is a
tendency to confuse \((B): A\rightarrow \Box \Diamond A\) with
\(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond A)\). But \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond
A)\) is not the same as \((B)\), for \(\Box(A\rightarrow \Diamond A)\)
is already a theorem of \(M\), and \((B)\) is not. One must take
special care that our positive reaction to \(\Box(A\rightarrow

theorems \(A\rightarrow({\sim}A\rightarrow B)\) and
\(B\rightarrow(A\rightarrow B)\). He introduced the symbol

This suggests that the context dimension is apt for tracking analytic
knowledge obtained from the mastery of our language. On the other

a first-order formula is equivalent to a modal translation exactly
when its holding in a model entails that it holds in any bisimular

abstraction to describe, and reason about, computation and other
processes. (After all, what really matters there is the preservation
of truth values of formulas in models, rather than the finer details
of the frame structures.) Furthermore, the implicit translation of
modal logics into well-understood fragments of predicate logic
provides a wealth of information of interest to computer scientists.

completeness results with respect to various conditions on the
accessibility relation. However as research progressed into the 70s,
deeper connections were discovered concerning what modal axioms
express about frames. A central idea in this work is the notion of
frame validity, which differs from the kind of validity which was laid
out in Section 6 above. There an argument was considered valid for a
set of conditions \(C\) on frames exactly when for every model
\(\langle W, R, v\rangle\) whose frame obeys \(C\), and every world
\(w\) in \(W\), the truth of the premises at \(w\) entails the truth
of the conclusion at \(w\). In short, model validity amounts to
preservation of truth on every model. Frame validity, on the other
hand, focuses more clearly on the frames of the model. A sentence is
said to be valid on a frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\) iff it is
true in every world in any model with frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\).
Then an argument is ruled frame valid for a set of conditions
\(C\) on frames iff it preserves frame validity, that is, for every

so is the conclusion.})",null,logic_concept,[],1

\(\Box A\rightarrow A\) true, even though its frame does not satisfy

because the valuation function for a model can be specially crafted so
that it does the work of ensuring that \(\Box A\rightarrow A\) is
true. However, as we will soon see, if \(\Box A\rightarrow A\) is
valid for frame \(\langle W, R\rangle\), then it follows that
\(\langle W, R\rangle\) is reflexive. By abstracting away from details

y(Rxy\rightarrow Py) \rightarrow Px\)]. (The basis for the
quantification over the predicate letters P is that frame validity
quantifies over all valuations of the propositional variables p, but
valuations over p are functions from the set of possible worlds to
truth values, and these can be likened to properties of worlds

obtains \(\forall x[\forall y(Rxy\rightarrow Rxy) \rightarrow Rxx\)],

\(\Box A\rightarrow A\) and reflexivity of frames \((\forall xRxx)\).
Similar results hold for many other axioms and frame conditions. The
“collapse” of second-order axiom conditions to first-order
frame conditions is very helpful in locating how axioms correspond to

that means (by soundness of GL) that \(\Box A \rightarrow \Box\Box A\)

\(s\) player \(i\) has the option of making a move that results in
\(t\). This collection of relations defines a tree whose branches
define every possible sequence of moves in the game. The semantics
also assigns truth-values to atoms that keep track of the payoffs. So,
for example in a game like Chess, there could be an atom \(\win_i\)
such that \(v(\win_i, s)=T\) iff state \(s\) is a win for player
\(i\). Model operators \(\Box_i\) and \(\Diamond_i\) for each player

of free logic and allows term constants in the language. Deutsch
(1990) shows how to define such a semantics, where the classical
principle \(\exists x(x=t)\) comes out valid. His strategy is inspired
by Kaplan’s (1989) idea that validity and necessity may part
company. (See the discussion of two-dimensional semantics in
 Section 10
 above.) Kaplan showed that there are sentences such as ‘I am
here now’ that qualify as logically valid, because they are true
in any context of their assertion, but which are not necessary. That
suggests a reply to anyone who objects to the classical theorem
\(\exists x(x=t)\) on the grounds that ‘\(t\) exists’ is
not necessary. One need only point out that the validity of \(\exists
x(x=t)\) is in fact compatible with its contingency.})",null,logic_concept,[],1
"(:Concept {section: 16. Quantifiers in Modal Logic,source: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/,type: logic_concept,content: Special adjustments to the formal semantics are needed to flesh out
this idea. Deutsch introduces what he calls ‘contexts of
origin’ as sequences of possible worlds. (These are not to be
confused with Kaplan’s linguistic contexts.) However, Stephanou
(2002) shows how to streamline the definition of a model so that this
extra machinery is avoided. Deutsch’s main idea is that a model
distinguishes one of the possible worlds \(w^*\) as actual, and the
term constants are directly assigned referents in the domain for
\(w^*\). That ensures that \(\exists x(x=t)\) is true in \(w^*\).
Although \(\exists x(x=t)\) is false in other worlds where the
referent of \(t\) does not exist, the definition of validity for this
semantics rates a sentence true provided it is true at the actual
world \(w^*\) for each model. The result is that \(\exists x(x=t)\)
and all classical quantifier principles are rated valid, even though
\(\Box\exists x(x=t)\) is not.})",null,logic_concept,[],1
"(:Concept {section: 16. Quantifiers in Modal Logic,source: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/,type: logic_concept,content: Stephanou (2002) provides a set of axioms and rules that exactly
capture this notion of validity. Classical laws of quantification are
preserved in the sense that the provable formulas lacking any modal
operator are the classical ones. However, restrictions must be placed
on the rules of propositional modal logic. The Necessitation Rule (If
\(A\) is a theorem, then so is \(\Box A\)) cannot be accepted because
\(\exists x(x=t)\) is valid, while \(\Box\exists x(x=t)\) is not.
Furthermore, the rules for quantification are more complex. Two axioms
of Universal Instantiation are needed. One is restricted: \(\forall
xA(x)\rightarrow(Ft\rightarrow A(t))\), where \(Ft\) is any atomic
sentence containing term \(t\). Since the semantics requires all
predicate letters to have extensions for a world in the domain of that
world, \(Ft\) ensures that \(t\) refers to something that exists. So
this restricted axiom reminds one of Free Universal Instantiation. The
second axiom is an unrestricted form of Instantiation: \(\forall
xA(x)\rightarrow A(t)\). However, this principle comes with the
proviso that once it is used in a proof, no axioms or rules may be
used other than it and Modus Ponens. This has the effect of blocking
the use of Necessitation to obtain \(\Box\exists x(x=t)\) from
\(\exists x(x=t)\).})",null,logic_concept,[],1

"(:Concept {section: 16. Quantifiers in Modal Logic,source: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-modal/,type: logic_concept,content: A final complication in the semantics for quantified modal logic is
worth mentioning. It arises when non-rigid expressions such as
‘the inventor of bifocals’ are introduced to the language.
A term is non-rigid when it picks out different objects in different
possible worlds. The semantical value of such a term can be given by
what Carnap (1947) called an individual concept, a function that picks
out the denotation of the term for each possible world. One approach
to dealing with non-rigid terms is to employ Russell’s theory of
descriptions. However, in a language that treats non rigid expressions
as genuine terms, it turns out that neither the classical nor the free
logic rules for the quantifiers are acceptable. (The problem cannot be
resolved by weakening the rule of substitution for identity.) A
solution to this problem is to employ a more general treatment of the
quantifiers, where the domain of quantification contains individual
concepts rather than objects. This more general interpretation
provides a better match between the treatment of terms and the
treatment of quantifiers and results in systems that are adequate for
classical or free logic rules (depending on whether the fixed domains
or world-relative domains are chosen). It also provides a language
with strong and much needed expressive powers (Bressan, 1973, Belnap

Zeno’s famous flying arrow paradox refers to the nature of time
and challenges the notion of change. Much of the early temporal
discussion, however, centered around the problem of future
contingents, i.e. the question whether statements about future
events that are neither necessary nor impossible can have definite
truth values. The most widely known and probably most cited example is
the sea-battle scenario discussed by Aristotle in On
Interpretation (Chapter 9). Aristotle argued that statements such
as “There will be a sea-battle tomorrow”, as well as the
contrary prediction “There will not be a sea-battle
tomorrow”, do not hold of necessity and hence lack definite
truth values at present, while conceding that it is necessary that
either there will be a sea-battle tomorrow or not. Somewhat later, the
philosopher Diodorus Chronus demonstrated the problem of future
contingents in his famous Master Argument, which led him to
define the possible as “what is or will be the case”. A

writers such as Peter Aureole, William of Ockham, and Luis Molina. The
central question here was how to reconcile God’s foreknowledge
with the idea of human freedom. Ockham, for example, embraced the idea
of a true or actual future, holding that future contingents are either
true or false even though only God knows their truth values. According
to Ockham, this is not to say, however, that future contingents are
necessary: there are alternative possibilities for humans to choose
from. Later, several philosophers and logicians engaged in the problem
of relating time and modality, proposing various different solutions.
C.S. Peirce objected to the idea that future contingents can have
definite truth values. He advanced the view that only the present and
the past are actual, whereas the future is the realm of possibility
and necessity. In a similar spirit, J. Łukasiewicz devised a
three-valued logic, treating the truth values of future contingents as
undetermined. For a more recent philosophical discussion on the open

Reichenbach, J. Findlay, J. Łukasiewicz, and J.
 Łoś.[1]
 From the early 1950s, Prior introduced and analyzed in detail over
more than a decade several different versions of Tense Logic, many of
which are discussed here. Prior’s invention of Tense Logic was
largely driven by philosophical considerations. In particular, the
Master Argument of Diodorus Chronus and the intricate relationship
between time, (in)determinism, God’s foreknowledge, and human
freedom played a pivotal role in his work. Prior was convinced that a
proper logical approach could help to clarify and resolve such
philosophical problems. He introduced temporal operators, studied
metric tense logic, was a pioneer in hybrid logic, and devised two
versions of branching time logic, which he took to reflect the views
of Ockham and Peirce, respectively. His work paved the way for the
development of the vast and diverse field of temporal logic, with
numerous important applications not only in philosophy, but also in
computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. For more

must also be Dedekind complete (i.e., every non-empty set of
time instants that has an upper bound has a least upper bound). The
ordering of the real numbers fulfills this condition, but the rational
numbers do not. To see this, consider the set of all rational numbers
whose square is less than 2 and note that \(\sqrt{2}\) is not
rational. An instant-based model of time is well-ordered if there are
no infinite descending chains (i.e., every non-empty, linear set of
time instants has a least element), and it has the finite interval
property if between any two comparable time instants there are at most
finitely many instants. The natural numbers are well-ordered and have
the finite interval property, the integers are not well-ordered but
have the finite interval property, and the rationals are neither
well-ordered nor do they have the finite interval property. Lastly, a

‘no transfinite forward (resp. backward) jumps’ (i.e.,

In total, they identified 15 different such combinations — or
tenses, as they called them (see Prior 1967, Chapter III.5).
These combinations seem to surpass the number of verbal tenses in e.g.
English, but there are also temporal features of natural language that
cannot be captured in TL: Prior’s temporal operators cannot, for
instance, distinguish between the simple past and the present perfect
(“I wrote a letter” vs. “I have written a
letter”), a distinction that drove Reichenbach’s work.
Moreover, they are not suited to model the linguistic differentiation
between perfective and imperfective aspect (“I wrote a
letter” vs. “I was writing a letter”), which is
arguably more adequately dealt with in an interval-based framework.

Yet, there are crucial differences between the two approaches. In
fact, in the early days of temporal logic, Prior’s approach was
perceived as a rival to more conventional approaches using first-order
logic. The rivalry between tense logic and first-order logic can be
seen as reflecting a fundamental distinction concerning the nature of
time, namely the distinction between the A-series and the B-series of
time introduced by McTaggart (1908).})",null,logic_concept,[],1

appropriate notion of change, and he rejected the A-series as
inconsistent because what is future now will be past, which, according
to him, requires that one and the same time instant has incompatible
properties. From this he concluded that time is unreal. For a detailed
discussion of McTaggart’s account and its philosophical

"(:Concept {section: 3.4 Tense logic, first-order logic, and McTaggart’s time series,source: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-temporal/,type: logic_concept,content: There is arguably a close correspondence between the A-series
conception of time and tense logic, on the one hand, and between the
B-series conception and first-order logic, on the other, as was
already noted by Prior (1967, Chapter 1). Consider, for example, the
sentence “It was light, it is dark, and it will be light
again.” This sentence can be formalized in TL as 
\[P(\mathsf{light}) \wedge \mathsf{dark} \wedge F(\mathsf{light})\]

while its first-order formulation reads 
\[\exists t_0 (t_0 \prec t_1 \wedge \mathsf{light}(t_0)) \wedge \mathsf{dark}(t_1) \wedge \exists t_2 (t_1 \prec t_2 \wedge \mathsf{light}(t_2)).\]
 The TL formula
consists of tensed propositions, and it invokes the local perspective
of the present. Accordingly, the truth value of the formula changes
over time. The first-order formula, by contrast, is built up from
tenseless propositions and has a fixed truth value once and for all.
Here we are provided with predicates of time instants rather than
tenses, and the perspective involved is an overarching, global one.
Prior felt that not everything that can be expressed in a tensed
language can likewise be expressed in a tenseless one, his classic
example being: “Thank goodness, that’s over!” (Prior

truth. From a philosophical point of view, however, the relativization
to a history is not entirely unproblematic. There are essentially two
different ways to interpret the Ockhamist history parameter. First,
one may think of it as referring to the actual course of events in the
tree of possibilities, and since this idea meshes well with
Ockham’s view on the future, Prior chose the label
‘Ockhamism’. This idea of an actual history has triggered
a variety of so-called ‘Thin Red Line’ theories (for a
discussion, see Belnap and Green 1994; Belnap et al. 2001; and
Øhrstrøm 2009). Second, one may think of the history as
an auxiliary parameter of truth that cannot be initialized in a
context: the context of utterance uniquely determines the time instant
of the utterance, but it cannot single out one of the histories
passing through that instant if the future is genuinely open. This
line of thought has given rise to ‘post-semantic’
accounts, which aim to bridge the gap between the recursive semantic
machinery and a context by introducing a notion of
super-truth, most notably Thomason’s supervaluationism
(Thomason 1970) and MacFarlane’s assessment-sensitive
post-semantics (MacFarlane 2003; 2014). These accounts sacrifice
bivalence, but they preserve the principles of excluded middle

Ockhamist frame introduced in Zanardo (1996). These kinds of
frames build on a non-empty set of possible worlds, each of which is
endowed with an internal linear temporal structural, and assume a
time-relative, historical accessibility relation between possible
worlds. That is, overlap of histories is replaced by accessibility,
and possible worlds are considered primitive elements, whereas in
branching time histories are defined in terms of instants. As a
consequence, if we merge a frame consisting of historically related
possible worlds into a tree, new histories may emerge that do not

and a branching time based approach can be overcome by equipping
branching time structures with a primitive set of histories that is
rich enough to cover the entire structure, a so-called
bundle. A bundled tree is defined as a triple
\(\langle T,\prec,\mathcal{B}\rangle\) where \(\mathcal{T} = \langle
T,\prec\rangle\) is a tree and the bundle \(\mathcal{B} \subseteq
\mathcal{H}(\mathcal{T})\) is a non-empty set of histories such that
every instant in \(\mathcal{T}\) belongs to some history in
\(\mathcal{B}\) (Burgess 1978; 1980). The Ockhamist semantics
straightforwardly generalizes to bundled trees, with the only
difference being that quantification over histories is now restricted
to histories from the bundle. Bundled tree validity is equivalent to
Kamp validity (Zanardo 1996; Reynolds 2002), but weaker than full
Ockhamist validity. Reynolds (2002) provides the following example of
a formula that is Ockhamist valid but falsifiable in bundled trees
(assuming instant-based atomic propositions); further counterexamples
were provided in e.g. Burgess 1978 and Nishimura 1979: 
\[\Box G(p \to \Diamond F p) \to \Diamond G(p \to F p).\]

Intuitively, the antecedent of this formula allows one to construct a
‘limit history’ in which \(p\) always holds. Such limit
histories may be omitted in bundled trees, which gave rise to
philosophical discussions concerning the adequacy of those frames (see

that assigns to each time instant a partition of the set of histories
passing through that instant, and truth at an instant is relativized
to one such indistinguishability cell, i.e. to a set of histories. For
details, see Zanardo (1998) and Ciuni and Zanardo (2010). An account
that is similar in spirit is the transition semantics
presented in Rumberg (2016). In that framework, possible courses of
events are construed as chains of local future possibilities, viz.
transitions, and can be extended towards the future. Transition
semantics introduces a second local perspective in time, which —
unlike Zanardo’s (1998) indistinguishability cells — can
be shifted independently of the time instant and which — unlike
MacFarlane’s (2003; 2014) postsemantic moment of assessment
— is incorporated in the semantics proper. The language contains
a so-called stability operator that allows one to capture how the
truth value of a formula about the future at an instant changes in the
course of time. For details, see Rumberg (2016; 2019) and Rumberg and
Zanardo (2019). Both the branching time logic with
indistinguishability functions and the transition approach subsume
Peirceanism and Ockhamism as limiting cases, namely the cases where

nominal. Nominals are special atomic symbols: they are
considered to be true at exactly one instant of the temporal model.
Hence, one can think of a nominal \(a\) as saying “It is \(a\)
o’clock now”. For this reason, nominals are sometimes also
called ‘clock variables’. The idea of nominals can be
traced back to Prior (1967, Chapter V; 1968, Chapter XI), who
considered the possibility of identifying instants with
instant-propositions: an instant can be conceived of as the
conjunction of all those propositions that are true at that instant.
The first mathematical exploration of hybrid temporal logic was given
in Bull (1970). In addition to nominals, hybrid languages are often
augmented by further syntactic mechanisms, such as satisfaction
operators, quantifiers over nominals, and reference pointers, which we
briefly discuss below. Satisfaction operators and quantifiers over
nominals can already be found in Prior’s work (see Blackburn
2006) and were reinvented independently in Passy and Tinchev (1985).

\(\mathcal{M},t\vDash A\varphi\) iff \(\mathcal{M}\vDash\varphi\). The
difference modality \(D\), on the other hand, states that the given
formula is true at some other instant. Note that both modalities
abstract away from the underlying accessibility relation.

respective atomic propositions and hence are tantamount to monadic
second-order quantifiers. The resulting languages are very expressive,

the quantified propositional version of LTL (which is decidable albeit
with non-elementary complexity), as well as the extension of CTL* (see

an object across different times. For instance, treating \(a\) as a
name for Aristotle, the sentence “Aristotle was sitting but now
he is standing” can be formalized as \(P\mathsf{sit}(a) \wedge

longer or do not yet exist, such as “the first child to be born
in South Africa in 2050”. The issues get even more intricate in
a branching time setting, where time and modality are combined. Note,

variety of 96 temporal-epistemic logics on so-called interpreted
systems, i.e. sets of temporal runs in a transition system with
epistemic indistinguishability relations on the state space for each
agent. The variety is based on several parameters: number of
agents (one or many), the language (with or without
common knowledge), the formal model of time (linear or
branching time), recall abilities (no recall, bounded recall,
or perfect recall), learning abilities (learning or no
learning), synchrony (synchronous or asynchronous),
unique initial state. Depending on the particular choice of
these parameters, the computational complexity of the decision problem
for these logics ranges very broadly from PSPACE-complete to highly
undecidable (\(\Pi^{1}_{1}\)-complete). For details, see Halpern and

"(:Concept {section: 9.2 Temporal logics and logics of agency,source: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logic-temporal/,type: logic_concept,content: Temporal reasoning is an important aspect of reasoning about agents
and their actions. Probably the most influential family of logics of
agency in philosophy is the family of so-called stit logics,
originating from the work of Belnap and Perloff (1988). These logics
contain formulae of the form stit\(\varphi\), reading
“The agent sees to it that \(\varphi\)”, which allow one
to reason about how an agent’s action choices affect the world.
The original versions of stit logic do not involve temporal
operators. Nevertheless, their semantics is based on Ockhamist tree
models, where an agent’s set of choices at a given time instant
is represented by a partition of the set of histories passing through
that instant. Roughly, the formula stit\(\varphi\) is true at
an instant \(t\) with respect to a history \(h\) iff the agent’s
choice at the instant \(t\) with respect to the history \(h\)
guarantees that \(\varphi\), i.e. if \(\varphi\) is true at \(t\)
relative to all histories in the choice cell containing \(h\). For a
detailed discussion of varieties of stit logic and their
historical development, see Segerberg (1992); Belnap et al. (2001) and
the entry on
 the logic of action.
 Temporal extensions of stit logics have first been proposed
in Broersen (2011) and Lorini (2013): in Broersen (2011) the
stit operator is combined with the Next Time
operator \(X\) into a single operator which requires that the
objective be met in the next step, whereas in Lorini (2013) the
stit operator and the temporal operators are treated
separately. Furthermore, in Broersen (2019) a spatial dimension is

alternating-time logics ATL and ATL*, introduced in Alur et
al. (2002). ATL and ATL* are multi-agent extensions of the computation
tree logics CTL and CTL*, and they have become a popular logical
framework for strategic reasoning in multi-agent systems.
Alternating-time temporal logics enrich the language with strategic
path quantifiers \(\langle\!\langle C \rangle\!\rangle \varphi,\)
intuitively saying “The coalition \(C\) has a collective
strategy to guarantee that the objective \(\varphi\) is met”,
where the objective \(\varphi\) is a temporal formula. That is, the
formula \(\varphi\) is required to be true in every path enabled by
the collective strategy of \(C\). While stit logics build on
branching time, ATL and ATL* are interpreted over so-called concurrent
game structures, in which paths are viewed as sequences of states
generated by collective actions of all agents. A combination of ATL
and stit theory was developed in Broersen et al. (2006). The
branching time logics CTL and CTL* can be regarded as single-agent

Particularly efficient and practically useful for this purpose are the

Beth, Hintikka, Smullyan, and Fitting. Unlike axiomatic systems,
semantic tableaux calculi are refutation-based systems: in order to
prove validity, one negates the input formula and shows that the
negation is not satisfiable. This is done by a systematic, tree-like
search for a satisfying model, and the search is guaranteed to find
such a model whenever it exists. If no model for the negation can be
found, the input formula must be valid. A survey on tableaux systems

rather than Prior style temporal logics have been used. Perhaps the
simplest first-order approach is the so-called method of temporal
arguments (McCarthy and Hayes 1969; Shoham 1987; Vila 1994). Here
the temporal dimension is captured by augmenting propositions and
predicates with ‘time stamp’ arguments; for example
“Publish(A. Prior, Time and Modality, 1957)”. An
alternative, yet closely related approach, is that of reified
temporal logics (McDermott 1982; Allen 1984; Shoham 1987; see Ma
and Knight 2001 for a survey). This approach makes use of reifying
meta-predicates, such as ‘TRUE’ and ‘FALSE’,
but also ‘HOLDS’, ‘OCCURS’,
‘BEFORE’, ‘AFTER’, and interval relations such
as ‘MEETS’, ‘OVERLAPS’, etc., which are
applied to propositions of some standard logical language (e.g.
classical first-order logic); for example “OCCUR(Born(A. Prior),
1914)”. Still, the modal-logic style approach has had a recent

three points in time: speech time, event time, and reference time,
where the reference time is a contextually salient point in time,
which, intuitively, captures the perspective from which the event is
viewed. Using the notion of reference time, Reichenbach was able to
distinguish, for example, between the simple past (“I wrote a
letter”) and the present perfect (“I have written a

salient point in time, on Prior’s account tenses are construed
as temporal operators, which are interpreted as quantifiers over
instants in time. This raises the general question: are tenses in
natural language to be treated as quantifiers, or do they refer to
specific points in time? In an influential paper, Partee (1973)
provided the following counterexample against a quantifier treatment
of tenses: the sentence “I didn’t turn off the
stove” means neither (1) there is an earlier time instant at
which I do not turn off the stove, nor does it mean (2) there is no
earlier instant at which I turn off the stove. The first requirement
is too weak, the second too strong. Partee suggested an analogy
between tenses and referential pronouns. According to this proposal,
tenses refer to specific, contextually given points in time (e.g. 8
o’clock this morning), which are presupposed to stand in
appropriate temporal relations to the speech time. Subsequently,
accounts that restrict quantification to a contextually given time
interval (e.g. this morning) have become popular. On these accounts,
Partee’s example sentence has the intuitive meaning: there is no
earlier time instant in the contextually salient time interval at
which I turn off the stove. Formally, this is compatible with both
quantifier and referential treatments of tense; for details see Kuhn
and Portner (2002) and Ogihara (2011). Moreover, the idea of combining
quantificational and referential elements can be dealt with in the
hybrid variants of tense logic discussed in
 Section 7.1

and quantification, the interpretation of embedded tenses and sequence
of tense, as well as the interrelation of tense and modality. For an
overview and further discussion on the application of temporal logics
in linguistics, see e.g. Steedman (1997); Kuhn and Portner (2002);
