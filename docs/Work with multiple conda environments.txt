Work with multiple conda environments in several powerful ways:

Nested environments:
# Create parent environment
conda create -n parent python=3.10
conda activate parent
# Create nested environment
conda create -n parent/child python=3.9



Side-by-side environments:
# Create multiple independent environments
conda create -n env1 python=3.10
conda create -n env2 python=3.9



Running multiple environments:
Open different terminals/shells for each environment
Each terminal can have its own activated environment
They run independently and simultaneously
Environment management:
# List all environments
conda env list
# Switch between environments
conda activate env1
conda activate env2


This flexibility enables:

Testing different package versions
Isolating project dependencies
Running conflicting packages
Development across Python versions
Parallel processing with different configurations

The key benefit is complete isolation between environments while maintaining the ability to run them concurrently for complex workflows or testing scenarios.
