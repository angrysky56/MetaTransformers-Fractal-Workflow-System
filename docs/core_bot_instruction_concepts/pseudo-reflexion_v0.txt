The diagram you provided appears to represent an agent-based model, specifically one that involves a learning mechanism (LM) with components for self-reflection, evaluation, and action based on interactions with an environment. Here is a high-level algorithmic representation of the system depicted in the diagram:

```python
class Agent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.evaluator = LearningModel()
        self.actor = LearningModel()
        self.self_reflection = LearningModel()
        self.trajectory = ShortTermMemory()
        self.experience = LongTermMemory()

    def observe_environment(self, environment):
        observation, reward = environment.get_observation()
        return observation, reward

    def act(self, observation):
        action = self.actor.decide_action(observation)
        return action

    def learn_from_trajectory(self):
        self.trajectory.update(self.evaluator.evaluate())
        self.experience.update(self.trajectory.get())

    def reflect(self, external_feedback, internal_feedback):
        reflective_text = self.self_reflection.generate_reflection(external_feedback, internal_feedback)
        self.experience.integrate_reflection(reflective_text)

    def main_loop(self, environment):
        while True:
            # Observe the environment and get the current state and reward
            observation, reward = self.observe_environment(environment)

            # Decide on an action based on the current observation
            action = self.act(observation)

            # Send the action to the environment and get new state and reward
            new_observation, new_reward = environment.update(action)

            # Learn from the action taken and its outcome
            self.learn_from_trajectory()

            # Reflect on the action taken, using both internal and external feedback
            self.reflect(new_reward, self.trajectory.get())

            # Check for termination condition (not shown in the diagram)
            if environment.is_done():
                break

class LearningModel:
    def evaluate(self):
        # Implement evaluation logic
        pass

    def decide_action(self, observation):
        # Implement decision logic
        pass

    def generate_reflection(self, external_feedback, internal_feedback):
        # Implement reflection logic
        pass

class ShortTermMemory:
    def update(self, information):
        # Implement update logic
        pass

    def get(self):
        # Implement retrieval logic
        pass

class LongTermMemory:
    def update(self, information):
        # Implement update logic
        pass

    def integrate_reflection(self, reflective_text):
        # Implement integration logic
        pass

class Environment:
    def get_observation(self):
        # Implement how to get the current observation and reward
        pass

    def update(self, action):
        # Implement how to update the environment with the given action
        pass

    def is_done(self):
        # Implement how to check if the goal is achieved or if the process should be terminated
        pass
```

This pseudo-code is a starting point for implementing the components of the agent-based model. It is important to develop each method (`evaluate`, `decide_action`, `generate_reflection`, etc.) in the `LearningModel`, `ShortTermMemory`, and `LongTermMemory` classes according to the specific requirements of the application. The `Environment` class should represent the external system that the agent is interacting with, providing observations and accepting actions.
