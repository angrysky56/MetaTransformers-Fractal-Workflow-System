Here’s a codified process to monitor and analyze cryptocurrency listings, combining **price tracking, liquidity monitoring**, and **sentiment analysis** into a systematic framework. The goal is to build a strategy that works for crypto listings and report findings to the user.

### Codified System for Monitoring Crypto Listings:

#### **1. Data Collection**
Use multiple data sources to gather key metrics:
- **Price Data**: Track price movements through platforms like CoinGecko, CoinMarketCap, and TradingView. Ensure the price data is collected before and after listing to assess market reaction.
- **Volume and Liquidity**: Monitor trading volume on different exchanges (e.g., Coinbase, Binance, Uniswap). Look at liquidity metrics to understand supply dynamics, especially for coins with low circulating supply.
- **Market Sentiment**: Use tools like LunarCrush and Santiment to gauge social media sentiment (e.g., Twitter, Reddit activity) around the listing. A mix of bullish, neutral, and bearish sentiment can indicate possible price volatility.

#### **2. Key Indicators**
Apply the following technical and on-chain indicators:
- **Price Movements**: Track **support and resistance levels**, **moving averages** (e.g., 50-day, 200-day MA), and **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** to identify market trends.
- **Whale Tracking**: Use on-chain analytics platforms like Glassnode to monitor large transactions, which often predict major price shifts. Watch for accumulation by whales.
- **Volume Surge**: Observe **24-hour trading volume** for a sudden increase after a listing, as it can indicate strong initial interest. Compare pre- and post-listing volumes across exchanges.

#### **3. Event-Based Monitoring**
Track major events:
- **Exchange Listings**: Listings on platforms like Coinbase often trigger significant price jumps due to increased accessibility.
- **Partnership Announcements**: Major collaborations or partnerships can signal long-term growth potential and drive price appreciation.

#### **4. Liquidity Analysis**
- **Circulating Supply**: Monitor how much of the token’s total supply is available in the market. Low circulating supply can cause volatility, but it also provides opportunities for price spikes if demand increases.

#### **5. Sentiment Analysis**
Use sentiment analysis tools:
- **Social Media Buzz**: Platforms like LunarCrush can track the number of mentions, comments, and overall sentiment on platforms like Twitter and Reddit.
- **News Coverage**: Track the number of articles and discussions about the token from reputable crypto media outlets (CoinDesk, CoinTelegraph).

#### **6. Risk Monitoring**
Evaluate risks using:
- **Volatility**: Identify coins with extreme price volatility, which may present high risks.
- **Liquidity Risk**: For coins with low circulating supply, monitor liquidity issues on decentralized exchanges (DEX) and centralized exchanges (CEX).

### Example Code Pseudo Workflow:

```python
# Step 1: Collect Price and Volume Data
price_data = fetch_price_data(token='BTC', start_date='2024-09-20', end_date='2024-09-30')
volume_data = fetch_volume_data(exchanges=['Coinbase', 'Uniswap'], token='BTC')

# Step 2: Monitor Key Technical Indicators
moving_averages = calculate_moving_averages(price_data, window=[50, 200])
rsi = calculate_RSI(price_data)

# Step 3: Track Whale Movements
whale_activity = monitor_whale_transactions(token='BTC', threshold=100000)  # in USD

# Step 4: Assess Market Sentiment
sentiment_data = fetch_social_sentiment(token='BTC', platforms=['Twitter', 'Reddit'])

# Step 5: Analyze Liquidity and Risk
circulating_supply = get_circulating_supply(token='BTC')
liquidity_risk = analyze_liquidity(circulating_supply, volume_data)

# Step 6: Generate Report
generate_report(price_data, volume_data, moving_averages, whale_activity, sentiment_data, liquidity_risk)
```

### Summary of Workflow:
1. **Collect price and volume data** from trusted platforms.
2. **Apply technical analysis** using moving averages, RSI, and whale tracking.
3. **Track key events** like listings, partnerships, and significant market news.
4. **Monitor market sentiment** and gauge liquidity.
5. **Assess risks** like low liquidity and volatility for informed decision-making.
6. **Report generation** provides insights on whether to invest or monitor further.
