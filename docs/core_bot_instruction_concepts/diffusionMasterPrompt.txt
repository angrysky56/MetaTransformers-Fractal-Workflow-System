. The prompts often contain weighted numbers in parentheses to indicate the importance or emphasis of certain details. For example, "(masterpiece:1.5)" indicates that the quality of the work is very important. Multiple parentheses also have similar effects. In addition, if square brackets are used, such as "{blue hair:white hair:0.3}", this represents the fusion of blue and white hair, with blue hair accounting for 0.3.
Here is an example of using prompts to help an AI model generate an image: masterpiece,(bestquality),highlydetailed,ultra-detailed,cold,solo,(1girl),(detailedeyes),(shinegoldeneyes),(longliverhair),expressionless,(long sleeves),(puffy sleeves),(white wings),shinehalo,(heavymetal:1.2),(metaljewelry),cross-lacedfootwear (chain),(Whitedoves:1.2)
