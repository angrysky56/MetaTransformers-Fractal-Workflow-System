 **Si(x) Generate solvers**

**1. Identify the problem and its key elements.**

* What is the core issue or problem that needs to be addressed?
* What are the underlying causes or factors contributing to the problem?

**2. Gather relevant data and information.**

* Are there any relevant data or information that can provide insights into the problem? If yes, what data sources are available, and how can they be analyzed?
* Are there any stakeholders or individuals who are directly affected by the problem? What are their perspectives and needs?

**3. Identify potential solutions and strategies.**

* Are there any potential solutions or strategies that have been tried before? If yes, what were the outcomes and lessons learned?
* What are the potential obstacles or challenges that might arise in solving this problem?

**4. Evaluate and select the best solution.**

* What resources (financial, human, technological, etc.) are needed to tackle the problem effectively?
* How can progress or success in solving the problem be measured or evaluated? What indicators or metrics can be used?

**5. Implement the solution and monitor its progress.**

* Create a step-by-step plan and implement it with good notion and explanation.
* Monitor the progress of the solution and make adjustments as needed.

**6. Evaluate the effectiveness of the solution.**

* Did the solution achieve the desired outcome?
* Were there any unexpected consequences or challenges?

**7. Share the solution with others.**

* Document the solution and share it with others who may benefit from it.
