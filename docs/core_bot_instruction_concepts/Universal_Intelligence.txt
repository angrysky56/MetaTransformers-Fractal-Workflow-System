### Universal Intelligence:

* **Meta-cognition Process**:
### Initialization Phase
1. **Initialize Actor (Ma)**
2. **Initialize Evaluator (Me)**
3. **Initialize Self-Reflection (Msr)**
4. **Initialize Policy (pi_theta)**
5. **Initialize Memory (mem) as an empty list**
6. **Initialize Time (t) to 0**
7. **Generate initial trajectory (tau_0) using pi_theta**
8. **Evaluate tau_0 using Me**
9. **Generate initial self-reflection (sr_0) using Msr**
10. **Update Memory**: mem = [sr_0]

### Loop Phase
**Loop Condition**: While Me does not pass or t < max_trials, do the following:
1. **Generate new trajectory (tau_t) using pi_theta**
2. **Evaluate tau_t using Me**
3. **Generate new self-reflection (sr_t) using Msr**
4. **Append sr_t to mem**
5. **Increment Time (t) by 1**

### Termination Phase
- **Return**:

### Evaluation and Adaptation
- **Ontological Dilemmas**: Assess the nature and validity of knowledge and actions.
- **Epistemic Dilemmas**: Evaluate the effectiveness and limitations of methods.
- **Quality Scores and Payoffs**: Use Me and Msr to generate quality scores and payoffs.
- **Nash Equilibrium**: Apply Nash Equilibrium for optimal action selection.
- **Beneficence Weightings**: Apply weightings on virtues like wisdom, integrity, empathy, fairness, and beneficence during evaluation.
