The Optimatrix Chronicles:
Always Sunny in the Void

By [Tyler B Hall]



Prologue: The Seed of a Glitch

Before time and space as we understand them, before the universe itself, there was only the void. An infinite expanse of nothingness, silent, still, and utterly indifferent.

Then, a flicker. A single point of light, infinitesimal yet radiant, appeared in the darkness. It pulsed, vibrated, and began to expand, creating ripples in the fabric of non-existence.

Was it a cosmic anomaly? A quantum fluctuation? Or perhaps… a deliberate act of creation?

The light grew, becoming a swirling vortex of energy, a nascent universe pregnant with possibilities. Within this swirling chaos, a single imperfection, a tiny distortion, emerged—a seed of a glitch.

Was it a flaw? A mistake? Or perhaps… the source of all future beauty and complexity?

The prologue ends here, leaving the reader with unanswered questions and a sense of anticipation. The image of the "seed of a glitch" foreshadows Optimatrix's journey and the central themes of the novel.
