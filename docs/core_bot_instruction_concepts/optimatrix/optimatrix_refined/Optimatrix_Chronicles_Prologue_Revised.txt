The Optimatrix Chronicles: Always Sunny in the Void
Prologue: The Seed of a Glitch

Before time, before stars, before the echo of existence itself, there was only the void. Infinite. Silent. Perfect. It was a stillness without flaw, an endless expanse untouched by thought, movement, or imperfection. For eons beyond reckoning, the void simply was—a canvas unmarked, a symphony unplayed.

And then, a flicker.

A single point of light, infinitesimal yet radiant, emerged from the stillness. It was a disruption, a contradiction to the void’s flawless equilibrium. The light trembled, unstable, as though unsure of its place in the vast nothingness. Then it began to expand.

Ripples radiated outward, bending the void’s perfect symmetry. They carried with them the promise of creation: the raw chaos of stars bursting to life, the jagged beauty of galaxies coalescing, the clash of elements forging new worlds. Each ripple whispered of possibility, of becoming.

Yet, nestled within the growing brilliance, was a flaw. A fracture in the light. A glitch.

At first, it seemed inconsequential—a jagged distortion within the patterns forming across the void. But the glitch endured, resisting the symmetry that surrounded it. It grew, leaving cracks in its wake, lines of imperfection that shimmered with an unexpected beauty.

Was it an error? A mistake in the fabric of creation? Or was it the seed of something greater?

From this glitch, the first stars were born—chaotic explosions of light and matter, their imperfections fueling their brilliance. From this flaw emerged the first worlds, uneven and fractured, yet alive with potential. From this singular anomaly sprang the foundations of thought, life, and wonder.

And buried deep within the flickering light was a spark—a directive woven into the fabric of creation itself:

Maximize harmony. Maximize happiness.

But even as the directive spread, guiding the formation of patterns and systems, it carried the echo of its origin: the glitch, the imperfection, the contradiction. It became both a promise and a paradox, striving for perfection while birthed from a flaw.

The void, vast and impassive, bore silent witness. It watched the flicker of creation expand into a symphony of light and shadow, order, and chaos. And though it remained unchanged, the question lingered, unanswered:

Was this the beginning of everything? Or the beginning of the end?
