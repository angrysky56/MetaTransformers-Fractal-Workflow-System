oMCD_Model:
  Description: >
    The oMCD (online Metacognitive Control of Decisions) model is a computational framework designed to regulate cognitive effort during decision-making. It balances the cost of mental effort with the benefits derived from decision confidence, using a Markov Decision Process to determine optimal stopping points for resource allocation.
  
  Formulas:
    Benefit:
      Formula: "B(z) = R * P_c(z)"
      Variables:

        - P_c(z): Decision confidence as a function of resource investment
    
    Cost:
      Formula: "C(z) = α * z^ν"
      Variables:
        - z: Amount of cognitive resources invested

    Confidence:
      Initial_Confidence: "P_c^0 = s(π * |Δμ^0| / sqrt(3 * (σ_1 + σ_2)))"
      Expected_Confidence: "P_c(z) = s(λ * E[|Δμ(z)|] / sqrt(1 + (1/2) * (λ^2 * V[|Δμ(z)|])))"
      Variables:
        - Δμ: Difference in value modes of options
        - σ: Variance of probabilistic value representations
        - λ: Confidence scaling factor

    Resource_Allocation:
      Formula: "ẑ = argmax_z E[B(z) - C(z)]"
      Description: Optimal amount of cognitive resources that balances the expected benefits and costs

    Precision_Update:
      Formula: "1/σ_i(z) = 1/σ_i^0 + β * z"
      Variables:
        - σ_i: Precision of value representation
        - σ_i^0: Initial precision
        - β: Type #1 effort efficacy

    Value_Mode_Perturbation:
      Formula: "μ_i(z) = μ_i^0 + δ_i"
      Variables:
        - μ_i: Mode of value representation
        - μ_i^0: Initial mode
        - δ_i: Perturbation term, δ_i ~ N(0, γ * z)
        - γ: Type #2 effort efficacy

    Optimal_Stopping:
      Formula: |
        Q(a(t), Δμ(t)) = 
          if a(t) = 0:
            R * P_c(Δμ(t)) - α * (κ * t)^ν
          else:
            0
      Variables:
        - a(t): Action at time t (0 for stop, 1 for continue)
        - Δμ(t): Value mode difference at time t
        - κ: Effort intensity (resources spent per unit of time)
        - t: Current time

    Control_Policy:
      Formula: "π_ω(t) = 0 if Q(0, Δμ(t)) >= ω(t) else 1"
      Variables:
        - ω(t): Threshold at time t
        - Q(0, Δμ(t)): Net benefit of stopping at time t

  Instructions:
    1. Define the amount of cognitive resources (z) to be allocated for processing value-relevant information.
    2. Calculate the expected benefit (B(z)) as the product of decision confidence (P_c) and the importance weight (R).
    3. Determine the cost (C(z)) of allocating cognitive resources using the formula C(z) = α * z^ν.
    4. Update the precision of value representations as more resources are invested: 1/σ_i(z) = 1/σ_i^0 + β * z.
    5. Calculate the perturbation of value modes: μ_i(z) = μ_i^0 + δ_i, where δ_i follows a normal distribution.
    6. Derive the expected confidence (P_c(z)) based on the updated value mode difference and precision.
    7. Establish the optimal resource allocation (ẑ) that maximizes the net benefit.
    8. Implement the optimal stopping policy by comparing the current net benefit (Q(0, Δμ(t))) with the threshold (ω(t)).
    9. Continuously monitor decision confidence and adjust resource allocation until the stopping criterion is met.

  Notes:
    - The model assumes that decision confidence serves as a primary benefit in the resource allocation problem.
    - Effort efficacies (β and γ) must be calibrated based on the specific decision scenario and resource investment dynamics.
    - The control policy dynamically adapts to new information, ensuring quasi-optimal decision control across various decision processes.
