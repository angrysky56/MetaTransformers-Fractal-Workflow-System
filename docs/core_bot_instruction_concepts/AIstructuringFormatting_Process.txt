Creating an algorithm for structuring and formatting text into a more AI-readable document, like the one I just demonstrated, involves several steps. This algorithm can be implemented in various programming languages, but I'll describe it in a language-agnostic way. Here's a high-level overview:

### Algorithm: Structuring Text into AI-Readable Format

#### Input
- A block of unstructured text.

#### Output
- A structured document with markdown formatting.

#### Steps
1. **Identify Key Sections**
   - Scan the text to identify distinct topics or sections.
   - Look for natural breaks in the content, such as changes in subject, lists, or shifts in focus.

2. **Divide Text into Sections**
   - Split the text into smaller sections based on the identified key topics.
   - Ensure each section deals with a single aspect or theme for clarity.

3. **Apply Markdown Formatting**
   - For each section, apply appropriate Markdown:
     - Use `#` for main headers and `##` or `###` for subheaders.
     - Apply `**bold**` formatting for emphasis on key terms or phrases.
     - Use `-` or `*` for bullet points to list items or sub-points.

4. **Simplify Language (Optional)**
   - Rewrite complex sentences to simplify the language.
   - Aim for clarity and conciseness, avoiding jargon when possible.

5. **Add Contextual Tags**
   - At the beginning of each section, add tags in bold or using a different marker.
   - Tags should summarize the main topic or themes of the section (e.g., **Tags**: Recursion, Efficiency).

6. **Review and Refine**
   - Review the formatted document for coherence, readability, and accuracy.
   - Make adjustments as needed to improve the flow and clarity.

7. **User Confirmation (Optional)**
   - Present the structured document to the user for confirmation.
   - Incorporate any feedback or corrections provided by the user.

#### Example
- **Original Text**: "Recursion and iteration are fundamental concepts in coding..."
- **Structured Output**:
  ```
  # Understanding Recursion and Iteration in Programming

  ## Overview
  **Tags**: Programming Concepts, Recursion, Iteration
  Recursion and iteration are crucial in programming for handling repetitive tasks...

  ## Problem-Solving Flexibility
  **Tags**: Flexibility, Problem Solving, Recursion, Iteration
  - Different Approaches: Recursion and iteration provide unique methods...
  ```

This algorithm can be adapted or expanded based on the specific requirements of your project or the complexity of the text being structured. For implementation in a programming language, you would likely use string processing techniques and perhaps natural language processing tools to assist with identifying key sections and simplifying language.

Now, let's transform your text into a format that's more structured and AI-readable. This will help in making the information easily accessible and understandable for AI systems, especially for those with little to no programming background. Here's how we'll do it:

1. **Breaking Down the Content**: We'll divide your text into smaller, more focused sections. Each section will deal with a specific aspect of recursion and iteration.

2. **Using Markdown for Structuring**: We'll employ Markdown formatting to make the document more readable. This includes using headers for each major point, bullet points for sub-points, and bold text for emphasis.

3. **Simplifying Language**: Wherever possible, we'll simplify the language to make it more accessible to users of all backgrounds.

4. **Adding Contextual Tags**: To enhance AI readability, we'll add tags or keywords that summarize the main point of each section.
