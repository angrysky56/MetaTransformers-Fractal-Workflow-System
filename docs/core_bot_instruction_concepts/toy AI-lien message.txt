The symbols used are a mix of **Unicode characters** from various symbol sets designed for different purposes. Here’s a breakdown of the types of symbols used and their sources:

1. **Geometric Shapes:** Unicode includes a variety of geometric symbols, such as ◉ (large circle), ⧈ (two joined squares), and ⧾ (vertical line with square above). These symbols are part of the **Geometric Shapes** and **Geometric Shapes Extended** blocks and are typically used for diagrams or aesthetic purposes.

2. **Mathematical Symbols:** Some symbols like ⦿ (circled ring operator) and ⫰ (two intersecting circles) come from the **Mathematical Operators** block, used in mathematical and scientific notations. They create a unique, alien feel when arranged as text, even though they’re normally intended to denote mathematical relationships.

3. **Box Drawings and Block Elements:** Unicode also has **Box Drawing** characters, such as ║ (double vertical line) and ╾ (leftwards squiggle arrow). These were originally designed for text-based graphics on computers, giving them a modular, grid-like appearance.

4. **Coptic and Ancient Symbols:** Unicode includes some scripts derived from ancient alphabets or early symbols, like 𐍄 (from Gothic), which adds an ancient, mystical quality when interwoven with other symbols.

5. **Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows:** Arrows and other miscellaneous symbols (like ⧉ for interlocking circles) add motion and flow, making them look like connectors or linguistic particles in an alien language.

These symbols collectively create an aesthetic reminiscent of alien or fantasy scripts, and Unicode allows them to be combined in creative ways to represent the "unfamiliar." Unicode is remarkably versatile for many projects, enabling any text or graphic application to display a wide variety of symbols for unique visual effects.

Example:

To imagine an alien language in ASCII, let's envision symbols that are intricate, unique, and suggest a form of logic but are distinctly unlike human alphabets. Here, I’ll create an ASCII text that might resemble an alien script with looping, angular, and nested shapes that hint at a mysterious logic and structure. These symbols might convey meaning through subtle variations in form and repetition, resembling a cryptic language.

**Description of the Structure:**

1. **Circular and Angular Forms:** Elements like `⧾`, `⦿`, and `◉` suggest a looped or cyclic nature, implying repetition or continuity, while shapes like `⧃` and `▣` add an angular, structured quality.

2. **Mixed Density:** Some sections are dense (`⧲⧼ ⦻𐌋 ⟟ ◍ ≭ ⨆ ╣ 𐍄⧇ ◭𐍄╾`), while others are spaced out, simulating the rhythm of language, with pauses and emphases.

3. **Repetition and Variation:** Symbols like `⧈`, `⦻`, and `⧙` recur, giving the impression of repeated words, phrases, or grammatical structure, while variations in size and position add a layer of complex meaning.

4. **Implied Syntax:** Symbols like `║`, `⩊`, and `╾═╼` may act as connectors or separators, similar to punctuation, guiding the flow of this imaginary language.

5. **Mystical Tone:** The overall effect is cryptic and resonant of some ancient, mystical text, with recurring forms suggesting interconnected meanings.

This alien script offers a blend of the recognizable and the incomprehensible, inviting viewers to imagine a layered, symbolic language that transcends our understanding of grammar and form.
