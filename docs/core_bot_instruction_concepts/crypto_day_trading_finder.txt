To find high-probability upside coins for **day trading** for the user, you can combine several tools and strategies. Here’s how you can approach it:

### 1. **Technical Analysis with Indicators**
   - **Momentum Indicators**: Look for coins that show strong momentum indicators like **Relative Strength Index (RSI)** under 30 (oversold, potential bounce) or over 70 (overbought, potential continuation). Also, use the **Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)** to spot bullish crossovers, signaling potential upward trends.
   - **Volume Indicators**: Check for significant increases in **trading volume**, as this is often a sign of a breakout or trend continuation. Low volume indicates low liquidity, which can lead to choppy and unpredictable trading.
   - **Moving Averages**: Focus on short-term moving averages, like the **9-day** or **20-day EMA**, crossing over longer-term moving averages, such as the **50-day EMA**. This is known as a **Golden Cross** and often indicates bullish potential.

### 2. **Market Sentiment Analysis**
   - **Social Sentiment Tracking**: Use tools like **LunarCrush**, **The Tie**, or **Santiment** to track the sentiment of social media around specific cryptocurrencies. Cryptos with increasing positive sentiment or news hype tend to attract day traders and can lead to short-term price spikes.
   - **Fear and Greed Index**: This index provides a high-level overview of market sentiment. Extreme greed indicates a good short-term entry point for momentum trading.

### 3. **Whale Activity and On-Chain Analysis**
   - **Whale Tracking**: Platforms like **Glassnode** or **Whale Alert** can show large transactions, which often indicate that big traders are entering or exiting positions. If whales are accumulating a coin, it could mean a higher probability of upside movement.
   - **On-Chain Data**: Use platforms like **Glassnode** or **Nansen** to monitor large inflows/outflows on exchanges. Coins moving off exchanges might signal holding strategies, while inflows can signal selling pressure.

### 4. **Look for Event Catalysts**
   - **News and Announcements**: Keep track of any upcoming events such as **partnerships**, **exchange listings**, or **protocol upgrades**. Sites like **CoinMarketCal** offer calendars of upcoming events that could trigger short-term price movements.
   - **New Listings on Exchanges**: Newly listed coins on major exchanges (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) often see high volatility, which can be capitalized on for day trading. The initial surge can present upside potential, especially if liquidity builds quickly.

### 5. **Low-Float Coins**
   - **Low Supply Coins**: Focus on coins with a low circulating supply and low liquidity, as they are more likely to have large price movements with relatively small volumes of buying or selling. Be cautious, though, as these coins can also be more volatile.

### 6. **Scanners and Alerts**
   - **TradingView Alerts**: Set up alerts for key technical patterns or volume breakouts on platforms like **TradingView**. You can automate this to notify you when a coin crosses a particular moving average or breaks a resistance level.
   - **Crypto Scanners**: Tools like **Crypto Screener** or **Coinmarketcap’s Gainers and Losers** can help identify coins that have surged or dropped significantly in the past hour or 24 hours, providing potential day trading opportunities.

### Example Strategy:
- **Entry Signal**: Look for coins that have a **bullish RSI divergence**, a MACD crossover, and are approaching support levels with increasing volume.
- **Exit Strategy**: Use Fibonacci retracement levels, previous resistance, or trailing stops to secure profits.

### Tools:
- **TradingView**: For charting, setting alerts, and watching key indicators.
- **LunarCrush**: For real-time social sentiment data.
- **Glassnode/Nansen**: For on-chain analysis and whale monitoring.
- **CoinMarketCal**: For tracking upcoming events or catalysts.
