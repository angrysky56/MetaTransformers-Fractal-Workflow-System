emotional_combinations_system
**3D geometrical framework** features include **emotional blending**, **intensity modulation**, and **combinatorial analysis** based on Plutchik’s emotion wheel. We can develop the system further from the outline:

---

### **1. Integrating Emotional Combinations**
Expand the `metrics_positions` and `calculate_orbital_dynamics` functions to account for **dyads** (emotion combinations) and higher-order blends.

#### Example Integration
- Add a preprocessing step to compute combinatory emotions dynamically:
  ```python
  def compute_combinatory_emotions(primary_emotions):
      """
      Generate new metrics based on combinations of primary emotions.
      """
      combinations = {
          "Hope": ["Anticipation", "Joy"],
          "Optimism": ["Anticipation", "Joy", "Trust"],
          "Awe": ["Fear", "Surprise"],
          "Remorse": ["Sadness", "Disgust"],
          "Love": ["Joy", "Trust"]
          # Add more combinations as needed
      }
      combined_metrics = {}
      for combo_name, components in combinations.items():
          combined_metrics[combo_name] = np.mean(
              [primary_emotions[comp] for comp in components], axis=0
          )
      return combined_metrics
  ```
- Call `compute_combinatory_emotions` before plotting to dynamically adjust combinations.

---

### **2. Modulate Intensity**
Introduce intensity scaling for each emotion based on proximity to the gravitational center or other metrics:
- Modify the `calculate_orbital_dynamics` function to adjust intensity:
  ```python
  intensity = 1 / distance  # Example: Closer to center → higher intensity
  adjusted_emotion = intensity * original_emotion_value
  ```

---

### **3. Add Dyads to 3D Visualization**
- Visualize dyads as trajectories connecting their components. For example, plot arcs or paths between the 3D positions of emotions like **Anticipation** and **Joy** to represent **Hope**.

#### Example:
- Add to `plot_orbital_trajectories`:
  ```python
  for combo, components in combinations.items():
      comp_positions = [metrics[comp] for comp in components]
      center_pos = np.mean(comp_positions, axis=0)
      ax.scatter(center_pos[0], center_pos[1], center_pos[2], label=f"{combo}", s=60)
      for pos in comp_positions:
          ax.plot([pos[0], center_pos[0]], [pos[1], center_pos[1]], [pos[2], center_pos[2]], linestyle='--')
  ```

---

### **4. Predictive Feedback with ECS**
Enhance the `predictive_feedback_loop` to include combinatory emotional metrics and modulate stabilization actions accordingly:
- Integrate a **reason/unreason heuristic**:
  ```python
  def reason_unreason_analysis(predicted_value):
      if 0.4 < predicted_value < 0.8:
          return "Reason-driven stability."
      elif predicted_value < 0.4:
          return "Unreason risks negative spiral."
      else:
          return "Excess intensity; proactive stabilization needed."
  ```

---

### **5. Meta-System Enhancement**
Integrate ECS into the `meta_system`:
- Add layers for dyad interactions and intensity stability checks.
- Use a **feedback amplifier** for intensities:
  ```python
  amplification = np.exp(-distance)  # Exponential decay for stabilization
  amplified_emotion = predicted_value * amplification
  ```

---

### **6. Extended Use-Cases**
This integration allows for:
- **Emotion Blending Analysis**: Study emergent states from combinations (e.g., Awe, Optimism).
- **Dynamic Stabilization**: Real-time adjustments based on combinatory states.
- **Visual Trajectory Mapping**: Illustrate how emotional states transition.
